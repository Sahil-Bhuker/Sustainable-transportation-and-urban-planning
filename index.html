    <h1>Welcome to our guide on Sustainable transportation and urban planning!</h1>
    <p> 
        Sustainable transport is transport that does not rely on the world's natural resources 
        such as coal, oil, and gas. Sustainable urban transport is important because it helps to
         improve air quality and releases significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions, which is 
         better for the environment.</p>

        <h3>Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning</h3>
        <p>Sustainable transportation is a type of transportation that can be sustained over the long 
            term. It is a way to reduce the environmental impact of transportation on our planet and 
            make it more livable for future generations.</p>
        <p>When we make transportation in urban planning a priority, urban planners can design our city
             infrastructure to encourage fewer polluting forms of transport. Simultaneously, as well as
              reducing greenhouse gas emissions we can work to reduce congestion and make mobility more 
              affordable, accessible, and cost-effective.</p>
        <p>Explains that transportation needs have grown significantly as the Vietnamese economy has grown,
             and that improved transportation planning, as well as urban spatial planning, is needed to 
             sustain economic growth. Under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, emissions from the transport 
             sector are expected to rise by 140 percent, while measures incorporated in the low-carbon
              development (LCD) scenario promise a 20 percent reduction in emissions in the transport
               sector by 2030. Specific measures that would accomplish this involve inland waterways,
                coastal freight, motorcycles, private vehicle standards, bus fuel, biofuel, and others
                . The Government of Vietnam (GoV) should promote systems allowing seamless travel between
                 one mode of transportation and another, and among systems managed by different operators;
                  such seamless interchange is possible if proper interchange infrastructure is available.
                   Analysis indicates that public transportation projects reduce congestion, lower accident 
                   rates, and lower the burden of disease as they improve air quality.</p>
        <p>Uses two models—a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and a revenue requirement model—to 
            evaluate the implications of the low-carbon development (LCD) scenario, developed based on bottom-up
             modeling using the Energy Forecasting Framework and Emissions Consensus Tool (EFFECT). The LCD scenario
              would have a positive impact on economic growth after a brief initial adjustment period, and analysis
               suggests that beyond 2019, gross domestic product (GDP) growth would be slightly higher under the LCD
                scenario than under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. As Vietnam undergoes the structural changes
                 inherent in the move toward a low-carbon economy, new export opportunities will likely open up, with
                  the strongest potential for growth in Vietnam emerging in low-carbon technologies and renewable 
                  energy technologies and services; implementation of LCD options is anticipated to have a minor 
                  overall impact on employment. The unit cost of electricity supply is projected to increase 
                  significantly under both the BAU and LCD scenarios.</p>
        <p>Outlines policy areas with recommended reforms to set Vietnam on a low-carbon development (LCD) path, including 
            energy price reform and aggressive efforts to improve energy efficiency in both the consumer and industry sectors.
             Barriers to the adoption of energy-efficient measures in Vietnam include lack of information, lack of readily available
              expertise, pricing issues, insufficient cost consciousness in some sectors, assignment of a lower priority to cost
               savings compared to expansion in investment, transaction costs, perceived high investment risks, and market failures.
                The government should consider aggressively replacing coal-fired generation with gas-fired combined-cycle gas turbines
                 (CCGTs) both on a stand-alone basis and paired with run-of-river (ROR) hydro, wind, and solar photovoltaic (PV). 
                 Adoption of supercritical coal combustion technology promises substantial emissions reductions, and renewable 
                 energy (RE) will play an increasingly important role in meeting Vietnam’s electricity needs in the coming 
                 decades. Mainstreaming low-carbon and green growth considerations into the planning process can facilitate
                 the development of low carbon cities.</p>
